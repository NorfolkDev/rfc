# /code-of-conduct

### The Short Version

Norfolk Developers are dedicated to providing an harassment-free conference experience for everyone.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any of the conference sessions or activities.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attenders. Behave professionally. Remember that any discriminatory (as in sexist, racist, etc.) or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Attendees violating these rules will be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organisers.

### The Long Version

Norfolk Developers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately

Exhibitors and sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Exhibitor staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
