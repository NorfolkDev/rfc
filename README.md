# Norfolk Developers RFCs

With transparency & community at the heart of nor(DEV): we present the RFC
repository. We're commiting to opening as many decisions to the community as
possible and encouraging colloboration on all aspects.

## What is an RFC?

To quote:

> RFC (stands for Request For Comments) is a document that describes the
> standards, protocols, and technologies of the Internet and TCP/IP.
> Since 1969, about 2400 Requests for Comments (RFCs) have been published on
> various networking protocols, procedures, applications, and concepts.

RFCs are used in a variety of technologies to enable Users to have a say in it's
direction and to express their priorities.

## How Norfolk Developers use RFCs

The majority of discussion, polls and RFCs regarding our community
occur on our [Discord](https://nor.dev/discord), this conversation is easily
lost or forgotten. This repository will act as a source of truth for processes,
rules & configuration of the community.
